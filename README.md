# My Pics

## Objective
Create a photo gallery out of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. Your gallery should have a large canvas at the top of the page to show the selected picture, and a grid of available pictures below. When a picture gets clicked from the grid, the canvas should update and show the selected picture. If you want to go above and beyond, try adding slideshow functionality.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

\* Note: Bootstrap is included if you would like to use it. However, it is possible to complete this assignment using pure CSS.

## The Code
```

├── index.html    - write all of your html here

```
## To-Do
- Set up the user interface (UI) of your photo gallery using HTML and CSS. The top of your page should have a canvas where the current picture is displayed, and the bottom should be a grid of photos that appear on the canvas when clicked.
- Devise a mechanism that will allow you to update the canvas upon clicking on a photo.
  - How will you know what image to put in the canvas upon a click event?
  - How will you replace old image in the canvas with the new one?
  - How would you implement slideshow functionality?
- Once you have thought out a mechanism for your photo gallery, implement it.
